# Movie Review Sentinal

This is the repository containing Python scripts for downloading, training and testing on the data.

Requires Python 3.6 or higher

The model is built with spaCy, which is a natural language processing library in Python. spaCy written in Cython which makes it extremely performant.

We use the [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
